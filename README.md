I request the program be run in a console* for the best experience

Syntax - ORIGINS

This converter is based on the logic that you would find in a CAIE O-A level exam (2023).
As such, the syntax is quite simple:

	1 - INPUT / OUTPUT
	2 - IF THEN ELSE / ELSEIF...ENDIF
	3 - CASE OF
	4 - LOOPS
		- FOR TO NEXT
		- WHILE ENDWHILE
		- REPEAT UNTIL

	5 - PROCEDURE (BYREF & BYVAL) / FUNCTIONS
	6 - RECORD <DATA_TYPE> // limited to only 1 implementation
	7 - EXTRA FUNCTIONS PROVIDED BY CAIE exam board: [9618_s21_in_22.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16571690/9618_s21_in_22.pdf)
	8 - Assignment of variables
	9 - Simple Arithmetic

	# I know that more things could be added, like array declarations of specific sizes, and opening and closing files, but, I built this program based on what a student might want to 
 	# convert based on questions, and since files in questions contain virtual data, users won't ACTUALLY be able to skim the file and do something with it, tho adding the functionality 
  	# might be fun :)
